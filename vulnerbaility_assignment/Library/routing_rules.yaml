# Metadata and governance notes
notes:
  - "This YAML emphasizes family and keyword-driven routing to maximize coverage without needing exhaustive plugin_id lists."
  - "Populate `plugin_id_rules` from your Tenable data export for authoritative exact matches."
  - "Weights are numeric: higher means stronger signal when scoring combinations of keyword rules."
